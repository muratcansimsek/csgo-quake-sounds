I forked Kiwec's project. It's the same version but I replaced the voices with female voices. I couldn't change some sounds, even that is enjoyable.

### FAQ

* Does it work in matchmaking ? On faceit ?

Yes.

* Will I get banned for using this ?

No. This is using [Game State Integration](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Counter-Strike:_Global_Offensive_Game_State_Integration), which is allowed by Valve.

* How do I add my own sounds ?

Drop your sounds in the corresponding `sounds` folder. Feel free to remove the ones you don't like, too.

Please keep in mind that only OPUS files are supported.
